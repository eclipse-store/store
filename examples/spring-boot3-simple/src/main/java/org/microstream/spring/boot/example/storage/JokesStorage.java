 * The {@code JokesStorage} interface provides methods for storing and retrieving jokes.
 * It is used as a part of the joke service in the application.
 *
 * <p>Here's an example of how to use this interface:</p>
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * JokesStorage jokesStorage = ... // get an instance of JokesStorage
 * jokesStorage.addNewJoke("Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!");
 * List<String> allJokes = jokesStorage.allJokes();
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example, a new joke is added to the storage and then all jokes are retrieved.
