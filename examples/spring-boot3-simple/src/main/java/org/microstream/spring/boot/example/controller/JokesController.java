/**
 * The {@code JokesController} class is a Spring REST controller that provides endpoints for managing jokes.
 * It uses the {@code JokesServices} to perform operations on jokes.
 *
 * <p>This class is annotated with {@code @RestController}, which means it is a Spring MVC controller and its methods return domain objects instead of views.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here's an example of how to use this controller:</p>
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * GET /joke?id=1
 * POST /add
 * {
 *     "joke": "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example, the first request gets the joke with ID 1 and the second request adds a new joke.
