= Serializer

The Eclipse Serializer is {product-name}'s serialization engine.
While it powers the storage layer internally, it can also be used as a standalone, high-performance replacement for standard Java serialization.
It converts Java objects to a compact binary format and back, handling complex object graphs including circular references, polymorphism, and collections.

== Key Features

* *High performance* — optimized binary format with minimal overhead
* *Full object graph support* — handles circular references, shared references, and deep object hierarchies
* *Automatic type handling* — new types are registered on demand during serialization
* *Type evolution* — built-in support for xref:storage:legacy-type-mapping/index.adoc[legacy type mapping] when class structures change
* *No annotations required* — works with plain Java objects without any modifications
* *Pluggable architecture* — customize type handlers, configuration, and serialization behavior

== Overview

The serializer is structured into several layers:

* *Serializer API* — the main entry point (`Serializer`, `TypedSerializer`) for converting objects to and from binary format
* *Type Handling* — manages type registration, type dictionaries, and type evolution
* *Persistence Engine* — the binary persistence layer that handles the actual data conversion
* *Custom Type Handlers* — extension points for controlling how specific types are serialized

== Getting Started

See xref:serializer:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] for setup instructions and basic usage examples.
