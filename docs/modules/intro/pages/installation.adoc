== Modules

These are the different modules that make up {product-name}.

=== Eclipse Serializer Modules

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|ArtifactId |Description
//-------------
|afs
|Abstract file system (AFS) layer.

|base
|Collection of common utilities. Math, IO, Exceptions, Threads, String operations, and so on.

|codegen
|Code generation framework for entity types and other generated artifacts.

|communication
|Communication layer for network-based data transfer and messaging.

|configuration
|General-purpose configuration layer.

|configuration-hocon
|Hocon extension for the configuration layer, which supports hocon, json and ini files.

|configuration-yaml
|Yaml extension for the configuration layer.

|nativememory
|Native (off-heap) memory management utilities.

|persistence
|Base persistence framework providing the foundation for object graph serialization and deserialization.

|persistence-binary
|Extension of the persistence base framework with a concrete implementation of the persistent form as binary data. This persistent form is superior to all text-based formats in storage and performance needs, making it the preferred method for storage and network serialization.

|persistence-binary-android
|Android-specific extension of the binary persistence layer.

|persistence-binary-jdk8
|JDK 8+ specific extension of the binary persistence layer with type handlers for modern JDK types.

|serializer
|High-level serializer API providing a convenient entry point for object serialization.

=== {product-name} Modules

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|ArtifactId |Description
//-------------
|afs-aws
|Common AWS file system abstraction base module.

|afs-aws-dynamodb
|File system implementation for AWS DynamoDB.

|afs-aws-s3
|File system implementation for AWS S3.

|afs-azure-storage
|File system implementation for Azure Cloud (Azure Storage).

|afs-blobstore
|Base for all blob store file system implementations.

|afs-googlecloud-firestore
|File system implementation for Google Cloud Firestore.

|afs-kafka
|File system implementation for Apache Kafka.

|afs-nio
|File system implementation for the non-blocking IO implementation (java.nio.file) of the JDK.

|afs-oraclecloud-objectstorage
|File system implementation for Oracle Cloud Services (Object Storage).

|afs-redis
|File system implementation for Redis.

|afs-sql
|File system implementation for SQL databases.

|cache
|JSR-107 (JCache) implementation for {product-name}.

|cache-hibernate
|Hibernate cache region factory for {product-name}.

|gigamap
|The GigaMap is a specialized collection aimed at optimizing performance and memory usage in {product-name}. It utilizes off-heap bitmap indexing to facilitate lightning-fast searches and lazy loading of objects, eliminating the need for manual reference management.

|gigamap-jvector
|GigaMap JVector integration for vector search capabilities.

|gigamap-lucene
|A specialized index implementation which connects to a Lucene directory.

|integrations-spring-boot3
|Spring Boot 3 integration for {product-name}.

|integrations-spring-boot3-console
|Spring Boot 3 console with embedded REST UI for {product-name}.

|integrations-cdi4
|CDI 4 (Jakarta) extension for {product-name}.

|storage
|Basic framework to manage a graph of Java data persisted as binary data as a database. Can be used both to implement an embedded database solution (in the same process as the Java application) and a standalone or server-mode database solution (in a separate process). Other forms of persistence than binary data are deliberately not supported because they would not bring any noteworthy advantages but many disadvantages for the task.

|storage-embedded
|Top-level framework for use in a Java application that adds an embedded database solution to its object graphs. Can be used directly in the program code of a Java application to comfortably and efficiently persist its data.

|storage-embedded-configuration
|Layer with support for external configuration files (XML, INI) and convenience functionality to create foundations for the embedded storage.

|storage-embedded-tools-storage-converter
|Tool for converting storage data between different formats.

|storage-embedded-tools-storage-migrator
|Tool for migrating storage data using OpenRewrite recipes.

|storage-restadapter
|Adapter for low-level storage data externalization. Used by the xref:storage:rest-interface/index.adoc[REST service] to adapt to a {product-name} Storage.

|storage-restclient
|Abstract REST client interface, which serves as a Java wrapper for the xref:storage:rest-interface/rest-api.adoc[REST API].

|storage-restclient-app
|Executable xref:storage:rest-interface/client-gui.adoc[client app] with web user interface, which connects to a REST service.

|storage-restclient-jersey
|REST client implementation which utilizes Jersey as a webservice framework.

|storage-restservice
|Abstract REST service interface, which uses the REST adapter to access low level storage data.

|storage-restservice-javalin
|REST service implementation which utilizes Javalin and provides REST endpoints.

|storage-restservice-sparkjava (deprecated)
|REST service implementation which utilizes SparkJava and provides REST endpoints. (Deprecated, use storage-restservice-javalin instead.)

|storage-restservice-springboot
|REST service implementation for Spring Boot which provides REST endpoints.
