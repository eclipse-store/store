== Modules

These are the different modules that make up {product-name}.

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|ArtifactId |Description
//-------------
|base
|Collection of common utilities. Math, IO, Exceptions, Threads, String operations, and so on.

|configuration
|General-purpose configuration layer.

|configuration-hocon
|Hocon extension for the configuration layer, which supports hocon, json and ini files.

|configuration-yaml
|Yaml extension for the configuration layer.

|afs
|Abstract file system (AFS) layer.

|afs-aws-dynamodb
|File system implementations for AWS DynamoDB.

|afs-aws-s3
|File system implementations for AWS S3.

|afs-azure-storage
|File system implementations for Azure Cloud (Azure Storage).

|afs-blobstore
|Base for all blob store file system implementations.

|afs-hazelcast
|File system implementation for Hazelcast.

|afs-hibernate
|Generic file system implementation for JPA / Hibernate.

|afs-kafka
|File system implementation for Apache Kafka.

|afs-nio
|File system implementation for the non-blocking IO implementation (java.nio.file) of the JDK.

|afs-oraclecloud-objectstorage
|File system implementation for Oracle Cloud Services (Object Storage).

|afs-oracle-coherence
|File system implementation for Oracle Coherence.

|afs-redis
|File system implementation for Redis.

|afs-sql
|File system implementation for SQL databases.

|persistence-binary
|Extension of the persistence base framework with a concrete implementation of the persistent form as binary data. This persistent form is superior to all text-based formats in storage and performance needs, making it the preferred method for storage and network serialization.

|storage
|Basic framework to manage a graph of Java data persisted as binary data as a database. Can be used both to implement an embedded database solution (in the same process as the Java application) and a standalone or server-mode database solution (in a separate process). Other forms of persistence than binary data are deliberately not supported because they would not bring any noteworthy advantages but many disadvantages for the task.

|storage-embedded
|Top-level framework for use in a Java application that adds an embedded database solution to its object graphs. Can be used directly in the program code of a Java application to comfortably and efficiently persist its data.

|storage-embedded-configuration
|Layer with support for external configuration files (XML, INI) and convenience functionality to create foundations for the embedded storage.

|storage-restadapter
|Adapter for low-level storage data externalization. Used by the xref:storage:rest-interface/index.adoc[REST service] to adapt to a {product-name} Storage.

|storage-restclient
|Abstract REST client interface, which serves as a Java wrapper for the xref:storage:rest-interface/rest-api.adoc[REST API].

|storage-restclient-app
|Executable xref:storage:rest-interface/client-gui.adoc[client app] with web user interface, which connects to a REST service.

|storage-restclient-jersey
|REST client implementation which utilizes Jersey as a webservice framework. 

|storage-restservice
|Abstract REST service interface, which uses the REST adapter to access low level storage data.

|storage-restservice-sparkjava
|REST service implementation which utilizes SparkJava and provides REST endpoints.
