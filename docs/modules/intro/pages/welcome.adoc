= Welcome

Welcome to the {product-name} Reference Manual.
This manual includes concepts, instructions and examples to guide you on how to use {product-name}, version {display-version}.

== What is {product-name}?

{product-name} is a Java-native object graph persistence engine.
Instead of mapping your objects to tables (like an ORM) or documents (like a document database), {product-name} stores your Java object graph directly in its native structure.

=== Key Benefits

* *No mapping required* — store plain Java objects without annotations, schemas, or mapping files
* *Ultra-fast* — binary serialization is significantly faster than traditional database approaches
* *Almost any Java type* — persist almost any Java object, including collections, records, and custom types, see xref:storage:addendum/supported-java-features.adoc[]
* *Flexible storage targets* — store on local file system, cloud storage (S3, Azure, GCS), SQL databases, Redis, Kafka, and more
* *Lazy loading* — load only the data you need, when you need it
* *ACID transactions* — full transactional guarantees for data consistency
* *Zero dependencies* — lightweight with no external runtime dependencies

=== How Does It Compare?

|
|{product-name}
|Traditional Database + ORM

|Data model
|Plain Java objects
|Tables/Documents + mapping layer

|Query language
|Java streams and methods
|SQL / JPQL / proprietary

|Schema management
|Automatic type evolution
|Migration scripts

|Setup complexity
|Minimal (1 dependency)
|Database server + driver + ORM framework
|===

You should be familiar with the Java programming language and you should have installed your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

== Quick Start

[source, java]
----
// Define your data model as plain Java classes
public class DataRoot
{
    private final List<String> messages = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<String> getMessages() { return messages; }
}

// Start the storage
DataRoot root = new DataRoot();
EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(root, Paths.get("data"));

// Store data
root.getMessages().add("Hello EclipseStore!");
storage.store(root.getMessages());

// Shutdown
storage.shutdown();
----
