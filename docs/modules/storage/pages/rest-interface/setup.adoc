= Setup

An application that will expose the REST endpoints needs one of the provided implementations by {product-name} or you need to implement the provided interfaces.

Currently, two implementations are available:

- SpringBoot 3.x REST Service
- Javalin REST Service
- Spark Java REST Service (Deprecated, will be removed in future versions)


== Spring Boot REST Service

In this example, we will use Spring Boot implementation that {product-name} provides. This requires a fully functional
Spring Boot 3 with Spring Web MVC already set-up and configured. If you are unsure how to do so, please consult the
original https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[SpringBoot] documentation.

Please add the following dependencies to your project:

[source, xml, title="pom.xml", subs=attributes+]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.store</groupId>
      <artifactId>storage-restservice-springboot</artifactId>
      <version>{maven-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <version>${spring-boot.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Using your preferred configuration format, please activate the REST service in your configuration.
For example using properties file the configuration looks like:

[source, properties, title="application.properties", subs=attributes+]
----
org.eclipse.store.rest.enabled=true
----

This is it. This configuration will provide an additional REST endpoint accessible via `/store-data/` providing information
about your store. If your application starts a web server on port 8080, and you haven't changed the default configuration,
the complete base URL will be `http://localhost:8080/store-data/`. Open it a browser to see further available URLs
provided by the REST service.

The REST controller is able to provide information about multiple Storage managers of your system. For a storage manager called
`some` its details are available via `/storage-data/some`. If you haven't changed the storage manager configuration and use the
default one provided by the SpringBoot integration, it will be available via `/storage-data/default`.

=== Additional Configuration

You might want to change the base URL of your service. This is possible using the configuration file of your SpringBoot
application. The corresponding property is `org.eclipse.store.rest.base-url`. The example below changes the base URL to
`/some/other/location`:

[source, properties, title="application.properties", subs=attributes+]
----
org.eclipse.store.rest.base-url=/some/other/location
----

== Javalin Java REST Service
In this example, we will use the https://javalin.io/[Javalin] implementation that {product-name} provides.

[source, xml, title="pom.xml", subs=attributes+]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.eclipse.store</groupId>
        <artifactId>storage-restservice-javalin</artifactId>
        <version>{maven-version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

=== Additional Configuration
If you want to change the default port (4567) or instance name (_store-data_) it can be done by using the program variables:

.Javalin REST Service - environment variables
[cols="2,1,4",options="header"]
|===
| Environment variable | Default value | Description

| `eclipse_store_rest_port`
| `4567`
| TCP port of the REST service (valid range 1â€“65535).

| `eclipse_store_rest_storage_name`
| `store-data`
| Instance name used in the base URL (without leading/trailing "/").
|===

== Spark Java REST Service

In this example, we will use the https://sparkjava.com/[Spark] implementation that {product-name} provides.
This has no dependencies to other frameworks and makes no assumptions about your runtime environment, IoC container,
dependency injection, web server or anything else.

Just add the dependency to your project, the logger is optional.

[source, xml, title="pom.xml", subs=attributes+]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.eclipse.store</groupId>
        <artifactId>storage-restservice-sparkjava</artifactId>
        <version>{maven-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
        <version>1.7.32</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Now use the resolver to connect the REST service to the storage, start it, and you're good to go.

[source, java]
----
EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start();
if (storage.root() == null)
{
   storage.setRoot(new Object[] {
      LocalDate.now(),
      X.List("a", "b", "c"),
      1337
   });
   storage.storeRoot();
}

// create the REST service
StorageRestService service = StorageRestServiceResolver.resolve(storage);

// and start it
service.start();
----

That's all you have to do to open the REST endpoints to access the stored data.

The base URL of the provided endpoints is per default: http://localhost:4567/store-data/ and you can find out all available endpoints on the root http://localhost:4567

=== Additional Configuration

If you want to change the default port (4567) or instance name (_store-data_) it can be done by using the rest service implementation directly, and not go through the _Resolver` as in the previous snippet.

The Spark service can then be customized to your liking.

[source, java]
----
StorageRestServiceSparkJava service = StorageRestServiceSparkJava.New(storage);
service.setSparkService(
   Service.ignite().port(8888)
);
service.setInstanceName("my-name");
----

This will change the base URL to http://localhost:8888/my-name/
