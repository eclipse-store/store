= Full Backup

A full backup copies the entire storage to a specified target directory or storage target.
The `EmbeddedStorageManager` provides the `issueFullBackup` method for this purpose.

== Basic Usage

[source, java]
----
EmbeddedStorageManager storage = ...;
storage.issueFullBackup(
	NioFileSystem.New().ensureDirectoryPath("full", "backup", "dir")
);
----

TIP: The backup can be written to any available xref:storage-targets/index.adoc[storage target], not just the local file system.

== When to Use Full Backup

Full backup creates a complete snapshot of the storage at the time of execution.
Consider the following when choosing between full and continuous backup:

[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
|Full Backup
|Continuous Backup

|One-time snapshot of the entire storage
|Continuously mirrors all changes

|Can be long-running for large storages
|Minimal ongoing overhead

|Good for periodic backup schedules
|Good for real-time disaster recovery

|Simple to set up
|Requires configuration at startup
|===

For most production use cases, the xref:configuration/backup/continuous-backup.adoc[continuous backup] is preferred because it is far more efficient and provides continuous protection.

Full backup is most appropriate for:

* One-time backup before a major migration or upgrade
* Periodic scheduled backups (e.g., nightly) as an additional safety net
* Creating a storage copy for testing or development environments
* Situations where continuous backup is not feasible

== Restoring from a Full Backup

To restore from a full backup, point the storage configuration to the backup directory:

[source, java]
----
EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(
	Paths.get("full", "backup", "dir")
);
----

The backup directory contains a complete, self-contained storage that can be opened directly.

== Backup to Different Storage Targets

The full backup accepts any `AWritableDirectory`, allowing you to write backups to different storage targets:

[source, java]
----
// Backup to a different local directory
storage.issueFullBackup(
	NioFileSystem.New().ensureDirectoryPath("backup", "location")
);
----

== Performance Considerations

[CAUTION]
====
Full backup is a *blocking operation* — the calling thread is blocked until the backup completes, and store operations are paused for the duration.
For large storages this can take a significant amount of time.
====

For large storages, consider triggering full backups during periods of low activity, for example via a scheduled cron job during off-peak hours or at night.
