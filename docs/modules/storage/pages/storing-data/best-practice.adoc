== Storing Hidden Encapsulated Objects

In some cases, it can be necessary to store modified encapsulated objects that cannot be accessed from your code.

[source, java]
----
public class ForeignObject
{
	...
	private HiddenObject hidden;
	...
}
----

In the upper code snippet, the "hidden" object cannot be accessed by `store(myForeignObject.hidden)` if no getter is available.
To allow such hidden objects to be stored after they have been modified, you have two options:

. Set the global storing strategy of the {product-name} instance to xref:storing-data/lazy-eager-full.adoc[eager storing] or
. Implement and set a custom xref:../customizing/custom-storing-behavior.adoc[`PersistenceEagerStoringFieldEvaluator`] for this field.

[source, java]
----
EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation()
	.onConnectionFoundation(
		f -> f.setReferenceFieldEagerEvaluator(
			new CustomEagerStoringFieldEvaluator()
		)
	)
	.start();
----

== Use Immutable data models

To increase performance, use immutable sub-graphs as often as possible.

Storing those with the provided xref:storing-data/transactions.adoc[convenience storing methods] or using a thread-local xref:storing-data/lazy-eager-full.adoc#eager-storing[storer] to insert those sub-graphs concurrently can give a great performance boost.

== Get objects that are persisted by a storer

Sometimes, it can be useful to get all objects and/or their assigned storage ID that are persisted by a store operation.

To do so, you can register a custom `PersistenceObjectRegistrationListener` implementation to a BinaryStorer to collect all objects registered by that storer instance.

The default storer will call the `onObjectRegistration` method for each object registered to be stored during the store phase. Implementers should be aware that this has an impact on the storer's performance.

[source, java, title="PersistenceObjectRegistrationListenerImpl:"]
----
public static class PersistenceObjectRegistrationListenerImpl implements PersistenceObjectRegistrationListener {

    private Hashtable<Long, Object> persistenceObjects = new Hashtable<Long, Object>();

    @Override
    public void onObjectRegistration(long objectID, Object object) {
        this.persistenceObjects.put(objectID, object);
    }

    public void clear() {
        this.persistenceObjects.clear();
    }

    public Hashtable<Long, Object> get() {
        return this.persistenceObjects;
    }
}
----

[source, java, title="usage:"]
----
//create a storer
BinaryStorer storer = (Default) storage.createStorer();

//register PersistenceObjectRegistrationListenerImpl implementation
PersistenceObjectRegistrationListenerImpl registrationListener = new PersistenceObjectRegistrationListenerImpl();
storer.registerRegistrationListener(registrationListener);

//store some data
storer.store(...);
storer.commit();

//get and process persisted objects
registrationListener.get().forEach(...);

//clean up
registrationListener.clear();
