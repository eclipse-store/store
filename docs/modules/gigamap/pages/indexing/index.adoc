= Indexing

Currently, the following index types are supported

- xref:indexing/bitmap/index.adoc[Bitmap]
- xref:indexing/lucene/index.adoc[Lucene]
- xref:indexing/jvector/index.adoc[JVector]

If you are dealing with huge amounts of text and want to provide a feature-rich full-text-search capability, the Lucene index is recommended. For vector similarity search (k-NN) on embeddings, use the JVector index. Otherwise, the built-in Bitmap indices are the way to go.
