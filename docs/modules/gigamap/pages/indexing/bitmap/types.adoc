= Index Types

The GigaMap's bitmap index supports various index types.

== "Normal" Index

This is just a standard index that can include duplicate values. In fact, this is the most efficient type, as the bitmap index can compress this dataset and minimize memory overhead.

[source, java]
----
// use the builder
final GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.<Person>Builder()
    .withBitmapIndex(PersonIndices.firstName)
    .withBitmapIndex(PersonIndices.lastName)
    ...
    .build();

// or register it after creating
GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.New();
gigaMap.index().bitmap().ensure(PersonIndices.firstName);
gigaMap.index().bitmap().ensure(PersonIndices.lastName);
...
----

== Unique Index

Index with a unique constraint.

[source, java]
----
// use the builder
final GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.<Person>Builder()
    .withBitmapUniqueIndex(PersonIndices.id)
    ...
    .build();

// or register it after creating
GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.New();
gigaMap.index().bitmap().addUniqueConstraint(PersonIndices.id);
...
----

== Identity Index

Unique index, which will be used exclusively to identify an entity. It can consist of one or more indexers.

To elaborate on that: When looking up or removing entities, the GigaMap doesn't traverse all data, as that would be too inefficient. Instead, it creates an internal query based on the index definitions to look up entries. If no identifier index is provided, a compound one will be created using all standard indices.

[source, java]
----
// use the builder
final GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.<Person>Builder()
    .withBitmapIdentityIndex(PersonIndices.id)
    ...
    .build();

// or register it after creating
GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.New();
final BitmapIndices<E> bitmap = this.gigaMap.index().bitmap();
bitmap.ensure(PersonIndices.id); // add index first
bitmap.setIdentityIndices(PersonIndices.id); // set as identity
...

== Binary Index

A special bitmap index designed for high cardinality.

This index exclusively stores long values.

Each long-bit corresponds to an entry, meaning there will be 64 entries max, no matter how high the cardinality becomes.

Currently it only supports equality queries.
Range queries are not supported yet.

== Choosing Between Regular and Binary Indexers

The bitmap index offers two families of indexers: **regular indexers** (e.g. `IndexerString`, `IndexerLong`) and **binary indexers** (e.g. `BinaryIndexerString`, `BinaryIndexerLong`). The right choice depends on your data characteristics and query needs.

=== Comparison

[options="header",cols="2,3,3"]
|===
|Aspect |Regular Indexer |Binary Indexer

|Cardinality
|Low to medium (few distinct values, many entities per value)
|High (many distinct values, few entities per value)

|Query types
|Equality (`is`, `in`), predicates (`is(predicate)`), and - depending on the index type - range queries
|Equality only (`is`, `in`)

|Key type
|Any object with `equals`/`hashCode`
|Must convert to `long`

|Memory
|On-heap hash table
|Off-heap bit-position array

|Null values
|Native support
|Requires sentinel value handling

|===

=== Use Regular Indexer When

* Indexed values have **low cardinality** — few distinct values shared by many entities (enums, categories, status fields)
* You need **predicate-based queries**, e.g. `firstName.is(name -> name.startsWith("J"))`
* You need **range queries** via `IndexerComparing`
* The key type does not naturally map to `long`

**Typical use cases:** enumerations, boolean flags, date/time fields, categories, multi-value fields

=== Use Binary Indexer When

* Indexed values have **high cardinality** — many distinct values (unique IDs, foreign keys)
* Only **equality queries** are needed (`is`, `in`)
* The key can be efficiently converted to `long` (numeric IDs, TSID, UUID)
* **Memory efficiency** matters for large datasets

**Typical use cases:** primary/foreign key indices, UUIDs, TSIDs, unique codes or reference numbers
