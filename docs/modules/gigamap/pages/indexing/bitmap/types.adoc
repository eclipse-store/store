= Index Types

The GigaMap's bitmap index supports various index types.

== "Normal" Index

This is just a standard index that can include duplicate values. In fact, this is the most efficient type, as the bitmap index can compress this dataset and minimize memory overhead.

[source, java]
----
// use the builder
final GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.<Person>Builder()
    .withBitmapIndex(PersonIndices.firstName)
    .withBitmapIndex(PersonIndices.lastName)
    ...
    .build();

// or register it after creating
GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.New();
gigaMap.index().bitmap().ensure(PersonIndices.firstName);
gigaMap.index().bitmap().ensure(PersonIndices.lastName);
...
----

== Unique Index

Index with a unique constraint.

[source, java]
----
// use the builder
final GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.<Person>Builder()
    .withBitmapUniqueIndex(PersonIndices.id)
    ...
    .build();

// or register it after creating
GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.New();
gigaMap.index().bitmap().addUniqueConstraint(PersonIndices.id);
...
----

== Identity Index

Unique index, which will be used exclusively to identify an entity. It can consist of one or more indexers.

To elaborate on that: When looking up or removing entities, the GigaMap doesn't traverse all data, as that would be too inefficient. Instead, it creates an internal query based on the index definitions to look up entries. If no identifier index is provided, a compound one will be created using all standard indices.

[source, java]
----
// use the builder
final GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.<Person>Builder()
    .withBitmapIdentityIndex(PersonIndices.id)
    ...
    .build();

// or register it after creating
GigaMap<Person> gigaMap = GigaMap.New();
final BitmapIndices<E> bitmap = this.gigaMap.index().bitmap();
bitmap.ensure(PersonIndices.id); // add index first
bitmap.setIdentityIndices(PersonIndices.id); // set as identity
...
----


== Binary Index

A special bitmap index designed for high cardinality.

This index exclusively stores long values.

Each long-bit corresponds to an entry, meaning there will be 64 entries max, no matter how high the cardinality becomes.

Currently it only supports equality queries.
Range queries are not supported yet.

=== Zero and Negative Values

All binary indexers support zero and negative values.
Internally, each indexer maps the key to a non-zero long representation because the bitmap index uses bit positions as array indices, and a value of `0L` would have no bits set.

For sub-64-bit types (`Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Float`), this mapping is collision-free — no two distinct keys ever map to the same internal representation.

`BinaryIndexerLong` uses `Long.MAX_VALUE` as the internal representation for zero.
As a consequence, `Long.MAX_VALUE` is not supported as an index key and will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
All other long values are fully supported.
