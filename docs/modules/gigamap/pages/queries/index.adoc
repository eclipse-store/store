= Queries

One of the key features of GigaMap is that you can query data before it is loaded. 

Queries are executed on the index; then, while traversing the results, all relevant segments of GigaMap's data are loaded lazily. 

The xref:indexing/bitmap/index.adoc#_indexers[indexer] instances are utilized to create query conditions.

Each of them comes with specialized query methods.
