= Defining Queries

Given these xref:indexing/bitmap/defining.adoc[example indexers], it is straightforward to define queries, just use the self-explanatory API.

This query searches for persons called 'John', `firstName` is a static imported field from the class where we defined our indices before.

[source, java]
----
gigaMap.query(firstName.is("John"));
----

Conditions can be linked with `and` and `or`, respectively.

This one searches for all persons called 'John' or 'Jim'.

[source, java]
----
gigaMap.query(firstName.is("John").or(firstName.is("Jim")));
----

Or use the `in` condition instead.

[source, java]
----
gigaMap.query(firstName.in("John", "Jim"));
----

It is possible to compare to fixed values, but we can also use predicates.
This enables us to use any custom logic inside query definitions if the predefined ones are not sufficient.

[source, java]
----
gigaMap.query(firstName.is(name -> name.length() > 3));
----
